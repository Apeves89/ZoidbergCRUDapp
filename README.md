Here is the link to my app: [CRUD App Link](https://obscure-coast-07598.herokuapp.com/)


## **Technologies used** 

My app was made using Node.js, EJS, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, Bootstrap/CSS and tiny amount of JQuery. This is all knowledge I gained during my 5 weeks at General Assembly's Software Engineering program.

## **Approach**

The images above are a quick mockup that I used to design app website. The index page would only display pictures of the projects and each would be linked to their own page. Those pages would then include more information about the project.


## **Thoughts & Future Improvements**

The basic idea of a CRUD app to display personal projects was accomplished with this website. Bootstrap made styling and positioning everything much easier. There is still much to learn/experiment with Bootstrap which I am limited only by my creativity.

My biggest struggle is that my creativity limits my ability to try and learn new subjects that can be used in more complex apps. Working/debugging with other students helped in more ways than one. It helped increase my debugging skills on material I already know and exposed me to other material that I haven't used in my own app.

I would like to add sign up/login functionality and incorperate two models into the app. Adding a search bar would be a good thing to attempt.

## **UPDATE January 31,2023**
Login/register fuctionality added to app. Created simple login/register pages to test functionality. Redesign coming soon.
