## **Technologies used** 

My portfolio website was made using HTML, CSS, and a small amount of Javascript/Jquery that I was able to learn throughout the first two weeks of General Assembly's Software Engineering program.


## **Design Approach**

The image above is a quick mockup that I used to design my portfolio website. I was going for a simple design where the navigation bar items  were linked to different sections of the page. 

The Home section was left open for design in the mockup. It was ultimately used as a Welcome page with a logo.

The About Me section was designed to display a brief description of my professional experience and how I am always open to learning new things. I included a mouseover feature to display images when certain words were hovered over.

The Projects section would be used to display any future projects I will create with a brief description about the project. I put the project images and descriptions in a carousel to show multiple projects.

The Resume section would display my education and professional experience. While I did not include my full resume on the page, I included a link to a pdf version of my resume.

I added a Contact section to link my Github and LinkedIn pages. Also, a link that will open up an email message to my contact email.

## **Thoughts & Future Improvements**

I believe I was able to accomplish my initial design while adding some styling to the page. I will need to practice and get comfortable with HTML & CSS since I haven't had much experience at all. 

I struggled with the layout of the page using Flexbox and getting things to align the way I wanted to. I had rewrite and restructure some of the CSS because I got confused as to what changes were being made. I worked through each section trying to eliminate properties that weren't making any changes.

I would like to come back to this and work through the media queries to make it a better mobile experience. I ran into some issues with media queries and instead used jQuery to make some changes when the screen size was reduced.
